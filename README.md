# Test Machine for automotive applications
A test machine  for automotive applications.
I've used Arduino UNO, LCD, a button and pull up resistors for ADC. The operation is basically reading resistor values from a automotive fuel level sensor and
comparing it with the model selection.
Fist of all; hence it's a test machine, we need to get the model values that we want to read and compare.So, I create functions for each model, after you called the model function, 
you are able to see the models' data from LCD, and you can compare the resistor values with the data you read from LCD.
